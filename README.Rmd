Concave hull with 'concaveman' C++ library. 

Modified from Mark Padgham's demonstration [concavetest](https://github.com/mpadge/concavetest). 

Install

```R
remotes::install_github("mdsumner/cchull")
```

Example

```{r cc}
library(cchull)
m <- maps::map(regions = "new zealand", plot = FALSE, xlim = c(160, 179), ylim = c(-50, -40))
maps::map(m, col = "firebrick", lwd = 4)
bad <- is.na(m$x)
lines(cchull(m$x[!bad], m$y[!bad], concavity = 15))

plot(ozmaps::ozmap_states$geometry[6][[1]][[14]][[1]], asp = 1/cos(42 * pi/180), xlab = "", ylab = "")
mat <- ozmaps::ozmap_states$geometry[6][[1]][[14]][[1]]
lines(cchull(mat[,1], mat[,2]))
```
