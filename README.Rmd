# concavetest 

Test package to benchmark Mapbox's 'concaveman' algorithm in both javascipt and
C++ versions. Requires `libv8` for the `concaveman` package which wraps the
`.js` version.

```{r setup}
library (concaveman)
if (!"concavetest" %in% rownames (installed.packages ()))
    remotes::install_github("mpadge/concavetest")
library (concavetest)
library (rbenchmark)
```

```{r benchmark}
x <- runif (1e5)
y <- runif (1e5)
h <- concave (x, y)
knitr::kable (rbenchmark::benchmark (
                                     concave (x, y),
                                     concaveman (x, y),
                                     replications = 100))
```
